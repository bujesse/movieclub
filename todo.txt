* Lists
    * create lists (top x of y, genre based, director based, actor based, decade based, etc)
    * lists like "oscar movies", "imdb top 250 movies of all time"
    * import lists from external sources (letterboxd, imdb, etc)
* popularity - create some sort of "obscurity" score
* support filters on the archive page

* idea: every time a new list takes the lead, record that, and be able to show a timeline of how the lead changed
